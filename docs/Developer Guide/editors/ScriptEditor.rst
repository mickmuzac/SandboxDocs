The Script Editor it the only GUI interface that lets you directly write
code. This code is injected into the VWF as either a new method or event
for the selected object. See `Scripting Guide <Scripting%20Guide>`__.

This editor has 3 tabs - methods, events, and properties.

The editor uses js\_beautify on all input code before displaying it.
Note that on some systems, the JS engine may insert "use strict". This
is not a problem.

This Editor allows the user to directly manipulate property values,
which may be dangerous.
