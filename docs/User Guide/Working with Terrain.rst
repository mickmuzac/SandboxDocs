Introduction
------------

The Sandbox allows you to create a special entity type to render
terrain. Like all Sandbox objects, the terrain object exposes properties
that can be manipulated by the author. By setting these properties, you
can control what landscape is rendered, how it looks, and its
resolution. The terrain engine that underlies the terrain object is
composed of several parts, each of which adds its own modifiable
properties to the terrain object’s interface. Use the terrain object
whenever you need a surface that would contain too many polygons to
render with a standard 3D model file. For instance, the scene above is
13,000 by 8,000 meters. With a resolution of 1 polygon per square meter,
this 3D asset file would need about 100 million vertices. The terrain
engine dynamically allocates vertices around the camera, and removes
vertices in the distance to create the image above, which uses only 100
thousand polygons.

Overview of the terrain engine
------------------------------

The terrain rendering engine is composed of several major components:
the quadtree, the algorithm, the generator and the shader. These parts
work in concert to create a seamless surface that dynamically allocates
polygons to details near the camera. The quadtree is responsible for
laying out terrain ’tiles’ in such a way as to make the geometry denser
near the camera. The generator manages a complex system to generate the
proper height for each vertex – this is actually off loaded from the
main Javascript thread into a pool of WebWorkers. This setup allows the
system to do other things simultaneously while the terrain mesh is
computed. The algorithm supplies the generator with the proper height of
each vertex, and the shader presents that information to the renderer.
The settings you manipulate generally will affect either the quadtree or
the algorithm. While we currently do not expose aspects of the generator
or shader to the GUI interface, we may do so in the future.

Setting the terrain resolution.
-------------------------------

Because the nature of the terrain engine is such that it is constantly
reshuffling the exact positions of the vertices, there cannot be a
simple ‘high’, ‘medium’, or ‘low’ resolution setting. Instead, you
manage the effective resolution by setting the size of the quadtree
tiles. A quadtree is just a structure that looks something like this.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image1.png
   :alt: 

The terrain system cuts space up into a grid organized something like
the image above, with the densest portion around the camera. Each square
above would be filled with one grid mesh, to generate a surface like
this.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image2.png
   :alt: 

Here, each portion of the quadtree is covered by a 4×4 grid of points.
This resolution (4×4) is the ‘\ **Tile Res’**. You can increase the
total resolution of the terrain by setting the **Tile Res **\ property.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image3.png
   :alt: 

Here is the same quadtree covered by tiles with a resolution of 16×16

**Info: **\ You can change the resolution of the terrain by changing the
Tile Res property. This property should be a power of 2 number, like
4,8,16 or 32.

You can also control how deeply the world is divided. The quadtree will
continue to be split until the size of each tile is equal to the Min
Tile Size.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image4.png
   :alt: 

In this image, the Min Tile Size is 4 meters – meaning that the smallest
tiles are 4×4 meters square. Note that the actual mesh is hidden here.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image5.png
   :alt: 

Here is the same terrain with a Min Tile Size of 16. Note how the engine
stops splitting the tiles after only a few divisions.

**Info: **\ You can change the smallest possible tile size with the ‘Min
Tile Size’

You can also set a maximum size for tiles. When a tile is larger than
this value, it will be hidden.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image6.png
   :alt: 

Here, the Max Tile Size is set to 32. The largest blocks were 64 by 64
meters, so they were not shown. You can control the total number of
tiles drawn at one time by making sure the Max Tile Size is set
appropriately. This could be so big that the user never sees that tiles
are missing, because they would be over the horizon. It’s usually not
necessary to render the whole world at all – the user can see only a
finite distance anyway.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image7.png
   :alt: 

Here is the same world with a Max Tile Size of 16. The 32×32 meter tiles
are hidden.

**Info: **\ You can change the largest possible tile size with the ‘Max
Tile Size’

Finally, the total size of the world is the ‘Extents’. The total terrain
system will not render anything beyond the extents.

**Info: **\ Extents means the total size of the terrain object. Nothing
will be drawn further.

Up to this point, I’ve been using simplified images to illustrate the
idea. Let’s look at a real wireframe from the terrain engine. Note that
I’ve done some tricks so we can actually get some top down views of the
structure. When actually running, the tree is constantly changing.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image8.png
   :alt: 

Notice how the resolution of the mesh falls off in the distance?

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image9.png
   :alt: 

This is the same terrain mesh when viewed from the top down. The densest
region is focused around the camera.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image10.png
   :alt: 

If I zoom out far enough, you can see the effect of the Max Tile Size.
At some point, the tiles stop rendering.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image11.png
   :alt: 

Likewise, if I zoom far enough, you’ll see that the quadtree structure
stops splitting finer. This is the result of the Min Tile Size.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image12.png
   :alt: 

Finally, here is the result of the Extents – there is some boundary to
the entire system.

For a first person view of terrain, we suggest a Min of 16, with a Tile
Res of 16, and a Max of 2048. Set the extents to whatever value you
require. These settings will give you a maximum resolution of one
polygon per meter.

For a flight game, something more like a Min of 256, a Res of 16 and a
Max of 8192 might be better.

Height Map Terrains
-------------------

The terrain object allows you to specify what algorithm you wish to use
to generate the terrain height values. You’ll note all the information
above applies only to the x and y distribution of the points – we have
not talked at all about where the Z comes from. Most readers will be
interested in loading terrain from a height map source. In order to do
this, you must first select the ‘heightmapTerrainAlgorithm’ as the
terrain algorithm for the terrain. This terrain algorithm will read
values from a file to set the Z position of the terrain points.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image13.png
   :alt: 

Click the field labeled ‘Terrain Generator’ on the properties panel for
the terrain object.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image14.png
   :alt: 

Select ‘Height Map’ as shown above. You may have to reopen the
properties panel, because selecting the terrain generator algorithm may
add or remove properties from the object.

**Note: **\ HeightMap is the only option above that currently is usable.
Unless you are a core developer, don’t worry about the other options.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image15.png
   :alt: 

You should now have a button that allows you to select a height map as
the data source. Click the button to launch the map browser.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image16.png
   :alt: 

Click the thumbnail of the image you wish to be the height map source.
Here, I’ve selected the checker pattern.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image17.png
   :alt: 

Look at this! The white parts of the image are high, and the dark parts
low. This is not a very realistic terrain, but you should be able to see
how you could create more interesting terrains with a paint tool.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image18.png
   :alt: 

Here is a much better heightmap. Let’s see what it looks like when
loaded into the engine.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image19.png
   :alt: 

Better! We can actually see some ridges and rivers in this image.

Still, this is not perfect, and not a good example of real world data.
Because images must use a color to represent a height, the precision of
the heightmap is limited. You can load a special format called a .BT
file, which is a better way to represent height, but is harder to
create. We’ll write a separate tutorial on how to generate a .BT file.

Height Map Terrain Materials
----------------------------

The HeightMap terrain generator uses a technique called ‘Texture
Splatting’ to mix together different images. This means that you provide
one texture that tells the terrain where the other textures go. For
instance, the material could be configured so that where the ‘MixMap’ is
blue, a water texture appears. This will be described in detail below.
The material also allows you to specify an overall image that will be
used instead of the tiling textures in the distance.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image20.png
   :alt: 

Each of the buttons above will allow you to select a texture. Let’s look
at an example Mix Map

./

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image21.png
   :alt: 

This image is used to place other textures. Where this image is blue,
the texture selected by the ‘Blue Channel Texture’ button will be used.
Likewise for green and red. When there is no color for an area (where
the MixMap is black) the Black Channel Texture is used. The MixMap will
stretch exactly once over the heightmap.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image22.png
   :alt: 

The image above illustrates this principal. I’ve picked grass, water,
and rock to illustrate the red, green and blue channel textures, and
sand for the black channel.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image23.png
   :alt: 

As the terrain gets farther away from the camera, the image specified by
the ‘Texture URL’ is faded in. You can see that effect here: notice up
the valley, the grass, rock and sand fade away.

.. figure:: terrain/terrain.htmlcd_Image24.png
   :alt: 

This is the image I’m using for the ‘Texture URL’. Like the MixMap, this
will stretch exactly once over the heightmap. It’s possible to use real
aerial photography for this image.

.. figure:: http://vwf.adlnet.gov/r/wp-content/uploads/documentation/tutorials/terrain/mountain.png
   :alt: 

Here, you can see that in the distance, the ‘Texture URL’ completely
replaces the MixMap.
