Common mesh importation is done form the ADL 3D Repository however, the
online sit Dropbox is also an excellent place to store and retrieve
COLLADA models and textures.

NOTE: there are a few ways to import meshes. The 3DR integration service
is the easiest and best way to import models, but it is also possible to
supply a URL to a COLLADA file. The server that hosts the file must
implement CORS, and have no authentication requirements.

NOTE: Also, when directly adding a file URL, you are at the mercy of the
importers and exporters - our system is completely bypassed.
