The ADL 3D Repository strips out animation on COLLADA files. Dropbox
will retain the animation with your .dae file.

When an object is imported via a direct URL, if the model contains an
animation sequence, you will find a tab in the
`PrimitiveEditor <PrimitiveEditor>`__ that controls that animation
frame.
